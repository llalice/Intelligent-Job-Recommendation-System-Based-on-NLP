# 🧠 Intelligent Job Recommendation System Based on NLP

A semantic-driven job recommendation system that matches user resumes with relevant job postings using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to improve the accuracy of job recommendations by understanding the **semantic similarity** between resumes and job descriptions. It leverages pre-trained **BERT embeddings**, a **Siamese architecture** for similarity scoring, and a **vector search engine (FAISS)** to retrieve and rank job postings efficiently.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🔎 Resume & job description semantic matching using BERT
- 🧠 Keyword extraction via TF-IDF & LLM-based generation
- ⚙️ High-performance retrieval with FAISS vector index
- 🎯 Multi-factor ranking (semantic score + keyword relevance + job popularity)
- 💼 Real-time recommendation via interactive web interface (Streamlit)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- HuggingFace Transformers & Datasets
- BERT / MiniLM / SentenceTransformer
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit / Flask (optional for deployment)
